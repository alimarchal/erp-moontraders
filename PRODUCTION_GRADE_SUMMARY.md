---

## ✅ What Was Fixed (Latest Migration)

### Migration: `2025_10_30_183215_apply_production_grade_double_entry_fixes.php`

1. **Stricter Debit/Credit XOR** - One side MUST be > 0 (no empty lines)
2. **Period Check on UPDATE** - Validates period when status changes to 'posted'
3. **Immutability Triggers** - Posted entries cannot be edited/deleted
4. **Positive Exchange Rate** - fx_rate_to_base must be > 0
5. **Report Group Validation** - Only 'BalanceSheet' or 'IncomeStatement'
6. **Unique Account Types** - Prevents duplicate type names

---

## 🧪 Test Results (All Passed ✅)

```
✅ Debit/Credit XOR (both zero blocked)

## 📋 Key Constraints

| Constraint | Table | Purpose |
|------------|-------|---------|
| `chk_debit_xor_credit` | journal_entry_details | One side must be > 0 |
| `chk_fx_rate_positive` | journal_entries | Exchange rate > 0 |
| `chk_report_group` | account_types | 'BalanceSheet' or 'IncomeStatement' |
| `unique(type_name)` | account_types | No duplicate type names |
| `unique(journal_entry_id, line_no)` | journal_entry_details | Unique line numbers |
| `unique(currency_code)` | currencies | Unique ISO codes |

## 🔒 Immutability (Posted Entries)

Once a journal entry is posted, these triggers block changes:

1. `trg_block_posted_journal_updates` - Cannot modify header
2. `trg_block_posted_journal_deletes` - Cannot delete entry
3. `trg_block_posted_detail_updates` - Cannot modify lines
4. `trg_block_posted_detail_deletes` - Cannot delete lines

**Solution for corrections**: Create reversing entries instead.

## 📊 System Statistics

- **Currencies**: 6 (PKR base + USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR)
- **Cost Centers**: 6 (4 departments + 2 projects)
- **Chart of Accounts**: 82 accounts (assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses)
- **Accounting Periods**: 4 quarters in 2025
- **Sample Data**: 10 journal entries, 20 lines (all balanced)

## ⚠️ MariaDB Note

If you see mysql.proc errors, run:
```bash
mysql_upgrade -u root -p
```

System includes fallback logic to skip triggers if system tables are incompatible.
